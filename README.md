# Book Engine Search

## Description

This was an extremely fun challenge. The topic of which was to learn how to translate a working app's routing systems from a RESTful system, to one that uses GraphQL to fulfill it's needs. I learned alot in this challenge, and I appreciated the opportunity to get a really complete look at GraphQL's 'under the hood' functionality.

## Installation

To install and run this program, please ensure all packages are correctly installed, using the "npm run install" command. You will then want to run the build command to create a "dist" folder, according to react standards. A develop command will run both client and server folders at once, allowing the front and backend to connect and run appropriately.
